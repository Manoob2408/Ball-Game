------------------------------------------------------Ball Game--------------------------------------------------------------
 
Implemented in html, css and javascript, floating Balls is a nice game that you play with your frind and your objective is breaking more retangles than him/her!

Your ball has a different color from your friend's.

But don't worry, there is a little panel which shows your score and if you win, there will be a win message on your screen. 



Here is what this game looks like:
