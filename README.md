# Ball Game
 
Ball Game is a multiplayer and multiscreen remake of the classic arcade game Breakout. It's made for study purposes to experience development on HTML, CSS and JS. 

Each player controls 1 bar which has a color coded ball the player must bounce around to break the bricks and score points.

A panel shows each player's scores. The player with the most points wins.
